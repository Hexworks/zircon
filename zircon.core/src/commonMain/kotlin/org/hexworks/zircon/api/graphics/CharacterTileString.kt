/**
 * A [CharacterTileString] is an aggregation of [CharacterTile]s. You can draw a
 * [CharacterTileString] onto a [org.hexworks.zircon.api.behavior.DrawSurface] and you
 * can expect it to behave in a way like handwriting would (if a string does not fit in a
 * line it continues in a new line).
 *
 * Text wrapping is managed by [TextWrap] which is an enum with `NO_WRAPPING` and `WRAP`
 * options.
 *
 * If a [CharacterTileString] is too long to fit on a `DrawSurface` the parts which would
 * overflow are truncated instead.
 *
 * If there is no wrapping and the text reaches the end of the line it will also be truncated.
 *
 * [CharacterTileString] comes with its own builder and you can create them in a simple
 * way from plain Java [String]s.
