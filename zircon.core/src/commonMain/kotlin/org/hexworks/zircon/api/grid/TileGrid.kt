/**
 * This is the main grid interface, at the lowest level supported. You can write your own
 * implementation of this if you want to have a custom grid handling algorithm
 * but you should probably use one of the existing implementations.
 *
 * This interface abstracts a grid at a more fundamental level, expressing methods for not
 * only printing titles but also changing colors, moving the cursor to new positions,
 * enable special modifiers and get notified when the grid's size has changed.
 *
 * If you want to write an application that has a very precise control of the grid,
 * this is the interface you should be programming against.
