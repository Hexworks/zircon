/**
 * The [TileGrid] is the most fundamental interface in Zircon. It is an abstraction
 * that lets you manage a 2D grid composed of [Tile]s. It also supports layering,
 * cursor handling, character printing, event handling, simple [Tile] drawing operations
 * and many more.
 *
 * You can consider a [TileGrid] as an easy to use **facade** for all of your tile grid
 * needs.
 *
 * **Note That** all [TileGrid]s have a [Layer] at index `0` that is used
 * for implementing the [DrawSurface] operations, and it can't be removed from the grid.
 *
 * In short all [TileGrid]s have at least **one** [Layer] in them.
