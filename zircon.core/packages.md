Contains classes that can be used to create animations. RexPaint file loading is also supported.

the related configuration classes.

# Package org.hexworks.zircon.api.behavior

[CursorHandler], [Hideable] or [Scrollable].

Contains color-related types that can be used for coloring [Tile]s.

# Package org.hexworks.zircon.api.component
