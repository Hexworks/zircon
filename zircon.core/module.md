# Module zircon.core

This module contains the core implementation files of *Zircon*. It does not include the platform-specific renderers,
only a `VirtualRenderer`. Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/README.md) for
details about how to set *Zircon* up in your project.

If you want to try *Zircon* you can check the project out and run the individual *examples* [here](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/tree/master/zircon.jvm.examples/src/main).

*Zircon* also comes with skeleton projects for *Java* and *Kotlin* that you can clone and use out of the box.
You can find the *Java* version [here](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon.skeleton.java) and the *Kotlin* version [here](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon.skeleton.kotlin).
