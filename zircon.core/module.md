# Module zircon.core

This module contains the core implementation files of *Zircon*. This module is multiplatform, so it can be compiled to any target. If you're looking for a platform-specific renderer implementation take a look at the other modules in the root folder:

- `zircon.jvm.libgdx`
- `zircon.jvm.swing`
- `zircon.mpp.korge`

Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/README.md) for details about how to set *Zircon* up in your project.

If you want to try *Zircon* you can check the project out and run the individual *examples* [here](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/tree/master/zircon.jvm.examples/src/main).

*Zircon* also comes with skeleton projects for *Java* and *Kotlin* that you can clone and use out of the box. You can
find the *Java* version [here](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon.skeleton.java) and the *Kotlin*
version [here](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon.skeleton.kotlin).
